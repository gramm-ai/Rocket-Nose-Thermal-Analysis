## Rocket Nose Profiles

The following six geometries are included for comparative analysis:

1. Conical
2. Ogive (Falcon 9)
3. Von Karman
4. Parabolic
5. Elliptical
6. Power Series (n=0.75)

These are generated using thermal-equivalent wall thickness modeling.

## Real-Time 3D Heat Distribution

The simulation features a dashboard showing:

- 2x3 grid layout of temperature profiles
- Color maps indicating nose-to-base thermal gradients
- Time, altitude, velocity, and Mach overlays

## Workflow Overview

1. **Mesh Generation**: Uses `create_rocket_noses.py` to generate parameterized, thermal-equivalent meshes.
2. **Physics Engine**: Loads mesh into `RocketPhysicsEngine`, configures simulation on GPU.
3. **Simulation Execution**: Launches 6 processes in parallel, each simulating one nose design.
4. **Visualization**: Produces interactive or saved 3D heat maps using `rocket_visualization.py`.
