# Rocket Nose Thermal Analysis

## 🎯 Project Vision: From Stable Diffusion to Rocket Science

This project explores an intriguing question: could the principles behind Stable Diffusion's image generation be applied to physics simulations? Specifically, could deep neural networks be trained to emulate physics processes in a way that permits much larger time steps than traditional finite-element analysis (FEA), while preserving accuracy?

### The Process: FEA → APE → GenAI + APE

Traditional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for complex systems can take hours — or even days — to complete. Engineers often spend months exploring design spaces. But what if we could train a Physics Engine DNN on thousands of FEA runs, producing an Accelerated Physics Engine (APE) capable of predicting physical behavior in a single forward pass?

**This repository is Step 1:** A GPU-accelerated differential physics FEA system designed to generate high-fidelity training data for the next phase.

### Why Rocket Nose Thermal Analysis?

As a test case, I've chosen a thermodynamic problem: simulating the thermal heating at the top of Falcon-9 rocket during the first 60 seconds of launch, examining how aerodynamic heating differs between sharp and rounded profiles. This provides:

- **Complex Physics**: Four coupled heat transfer mechanisms
- **Design Relevance**: Direct impact on spacecraft survivability
- **Rich Dataset**: 36,000 timesteps across 6 profiles for AI training
- **Validation Data**: Publicly available Falcon 9 specifications

### The Three-Phase Journey

1. **Current Phase (This Repo)**: High-fidelity FEA simulation with GPU acceleration
2. **Next Phase**: Train DNN on FEA results to create Accelerated Physics Engine
3. **Final Phase**: Integrate APE into generative AI for natural language design

Imagine a system where an engineer can simply describe their requirements in natural language: "Design a nose cone that minimizes peak temperature while maintaining a drag coefficient below 0.45 and fitting within a 5-meter envelope"

## 🚀 Overview

Advanced Finite Element Analysis (FEA) system for thermal analysis of rocket nose cone designs during atmospheric flight. This GPU-accelerated implementation integrates all four heat transfer mechanisms simultaneously, solving the coupled differential equations at every node in the mesh, at every timestep. For a fine-resolution mesh with ~120,000 nodes and 60 seconds of simulation time at 0.01s timesteps, this means approximately 720 million calculations per profile.

**Performance Achievement**: What would take more than 5–20 hours with traditional methods now completes in 5 minutes for a single nose profile through strategic optimizations.

**Key Features:**
- **GPU-Accelerated Physics**: Optimized for NVIDIA RTX 3090 with CUDA support
- **Adaptive Time Stepping**: Fourier-number-based stability control for accurate heat diffusion
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous simulation of 6 nose profiles using multiprocessing
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Live 3D temperature distribution with FEA mesh overlay
- **High-Fidelity Meshes**: Hexahedral elements with 19,200-46,080 nodes per profile
- **Thermal Equivalent Modeling**: Accounts for structural mass (stringers, frames) in heat capacity

## 🔬 Nose Profiles Analyzed

After 60 seconds of flight simulation, thermal performance varies significantly:

| Profile | Type | Length | Max Temp | Characteristics |
|---------|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Elliptical** | Blunt | 3.5m | 245.9°C | Best heat distribution |
| **Von Karman** | Optimized | 7.0m | 251.0°C | Minimum drag design |
| **Ogive (Falcon 9)** | Standard | 6.5m | 251.9°C | Baseline reference |
| **Parabolic** | Smooth | 5.5m | 252.4°C | Gradual transition |
| **Power Series** | n=0.5 | 5.0m | 249.6°C | Enhanced curvature |
| **Conical** | Sharp | 4.0m | 262.1°C | Maximum heating |

The elliptical profile, despite its shorter length (4m vs 6.5m for ogive), demonstrates superior heat distribution, validating the importance of shape optimization beyond simple drag reduction.

## 📈 Physics Simulation

During launch, a rocket nose cone experiences a violent symphony of physical phenomena:

### 1. Aerodynamic Heating (Stagnation & Boundary Layer)

Air molecules can't get out of the way fast enough. They pile up at the stagnation point, converting kinetic energy into heat through compression.

**Recovery Temperature:**
```
T_recovery = T_ambient × (1 + r × (γ-1)/2 × M²)
```
where:
- `T_ambient` = Atmospheric temperature (K)
- `r` = Recovery factor (0.87-0.90 for turbulent flow)
- `γ` = Specific heat ratio (1.4 for air)
- `M` = Mach number

**Stagnation Point Heat Flux (Sutton-Graves):**
```
q_stag = K_sg × √(ρ/R_nose) × V³
```
where:
- `K_sg` = Sutton-Graves constant (1.1×10⁻⁴)
- `ρ` = Air density (kg/m³)
- `R_nose` = Nose radius (m)
- `V` = Velocity (m/s)

### 2. Heat Conduction (Fourier's Law)

The accumulating heat doesn't stay at the surface. It conducts through the aluminum-lithium alloy structure following Fourier's law.

**3D Transient Heat Equation:**
```
∂T/∂t = α × ∇²T = α × (∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² + ∂²T/∂z²)
```
where:
- `α` = Thermal diffusivity = `k/(ρ×cp)` (m²/s)
- `k` = Thermal conductivity (120 W/m·K for Al-Li)
- `ρ` = Density (2700 kg/m³)
- `cp` = Specific heat (900 J/kg·K)

**FEM Discretization:**
```
[M]{Ṫ} + [K]{T} = {Q}
```
where:
- `[M]` = Mass matrix
- `[K]` = Stiffness (conductivity) matrix
- `{Q}` = Heat flux vector

### 3. Radiation Cooling (Stefan-Boltzmann)

Following Stefan-Boltzmann law, the hot surface radiates energy to the cold sky.

**Radiation Heat Flux:**
```
q_rad = ε × σ × (T_surface⁴ - T_sky⁴)
```
where:
- `ε` = Surface emissivity (0.8 for oxidized aluminum)
- `σ` = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²·K⁴)
- `T_surface` = Surface temperature (K)
- `T_sky` = Sky temperature (K)

### 4. Convection (Forced & Natural)

**Convective Heat Transfer:**
```
q_conv = h × (T_surface - T_ambient)
```

**Heat Transfer Coefficient (Turbulent Flow):**
```
Nu = 0.037 × Re^0.8 × Pr^(1/3)
h = Nu × k_air / L_characteristic
```
where:
- `Nu` = Nusselt number
- `Re` = Reynolds number = `ρVL/μ`
- `Pr` = Prandtl number (≈0.7 for air)
- `k_air` = Thermal conductivity of air

### Adaptive Time Stepping

The simulation uses multiple stability criteria:

**Fourier Number Criterion:**
```
Fo = α × Δt / L² < 0.4
Δt_fourier = 0.4 × L² / α
```

**Temperature Change Criterion:**
```
Δt_temp = ΔT_target / max(|dT/dt|)
```

**Optimal Time Step:**
```
Δt = min(Δt_fourier, Δt_temp, Δt_max)
```

### Material Properties (Al-Li 2195)
- Thermal Conductivity: k = 120 W/(m·K)
- Density: ρ = 2700 kg/m³
- Specific Heat: cp = 900 J/(kg·K)
- Thermal Diffusivity: α = k/(ρ×cp) = 4.94×10⁻⁵ m²/s
- Emissivity: ε = 0.8
- Melting Point: 620°C (893 K)

## 📊 Visualization System

- Temperature distribution with color mapping (blue=cold, red=hot)
- Black mesh overlay for structural visibility
- Flight status display (altitude, velocity, Mach number)
- Per-profile statistics (max, mean, std deviation)

## 🔧 Strategic Design Decisions

### Why Just the Nose?

The first key optimization wasn't computational — it was conceptual. Rather than simulating the entire 70-meter Falcon 9 vehicle, we focused exclusively on the nose cone region. This decision reduced our computational domain by 93% while capturing 95% of the critical thermal phenomena:

- **Highest Heat Flux**: The nose experiences stagnation point heating
- **Maximum Temperature Gradients**: Critical for material stress analysis
- **Design Criticality**: Nose shape directly impacts drag, heating, and payload volume
- **Boundary Simplification**: Natural thermal boundary at nose-body interface

### Why Hexahedral Elements?

While tetrahedral elements are easier to generate for complex geometries, hexahedral (brick-shaped) elements offer better performance for thin-wall structures:

- **Reduced Numerical Locking**: Better handling of thermal gradients
- **Orthogonal Heat Flow**: Natural alignment with expected heat paths
- **Computational Efficiency**: 8 nodes vs 10 for tetrahedra = 20% fewer DOFs
- **Memory Optimization**: Better cache locality for GPU operations

## 📊 Performance Optimization Stack

Combined Effect: What would take more than 5–20 hours with traditional methods on similar computer now completes in 5 minutes for a single nose profile.

| Optimization | Impact | Speedup |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Nose-Only Domain | 92% mesh reduction | 10x |
| Hexahedral Elements | 20% fewer DOFs | 1.3x |
| GPU Acceleration | Parallel compute | 4x |
| Process Parallelism | 6 concurrent simulations | 6x |
| Adaptive Timestepping | Dynamic dt | 1.5x |
| **Combined Effect** | **Total** | **24x** |

### GPU Memory Management
```python
# RTX 3090 with 24GB VRAM
memory_per_sim = 3.5  # GB
max_concurrent = min(
    6,  # Total profiles
    int(gpu_memory / memory_per_sim),  # GPU limit
    optimal_cpu_cores  # CPU bottleneck
)
```

## 🎯 The Road Ahead: From FEA to GenAI

### Current Dataset
With 6 profiles × 6000 timesteps = 36,000 high-fidelity data points, we have sufficient training data for a preliminary DNN.

### Next Steps (Future Work)
1. **DNN Architecture**: Design network for spatiotemporal heat dynamics
2. **Training Strategy**: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
3. **Validation Framework**: Compare APE against reserved FEA cases
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Understand APE trust boundaries

### The GenAI Vision
What currently takes months of iterative design could be accomplished in hours through:
- Natural language design specifications
- Instant thermal prediction (<100ms per design)
- Multi-objective optimization
- Pareto-optimal solutions with confidence intervals
